I did it attentively, so I hope you can enjoy it. The use of the interface is as follows:

### 2. Comments and Considerations

* The platform I developed at that time was Windows. So if you are Linux or macOS user, maybe you can't run this project code normally. 

* Please do your homework independently, so you can learn for reference, but it's better not to plagiarize

### 3. Encoding format

.C Text is encoded with **UTF-8**, But the .text Text is encoded with **GBK**. Please forgive me.

### 4. Joke
 I'm a freshman in the computer science and engineering. Follow me~~~!

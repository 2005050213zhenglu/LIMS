## Library Information Management System

### 1. Reasons for do this project.

I'm a freshman of Electrical Information Innovation Experiment Class 2016 fall, [Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering](http://ee.dlut.edu.cn/en_.htm), [Dalian Univ. of Tech.](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/) and this project is the curriculum design of "C language course". 

I have done it for a week attentively, so I hope you can enjoy it. The screenshots of using are as follows:

### 2. Comments and Considerations

* The platform I developed at that time was Windows. So if you are Linux or macOS user, maybe you can't run this project code normally. 

* Please do your homework independently, so you can learn for reference, but it's better not to plagiarize.

### 3. Encoding format

.C Text is encoded with **UTF-8**, But the .text Text is encoded with **GBK**.
